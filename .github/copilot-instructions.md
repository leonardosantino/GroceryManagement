## Application

This is a management application for seller's e-commerce where they will manage products, orders and deliveries.

All UI components, layouts, and interactions should be designed and optimized for desktop only.
Do not implement responsive designs for mobile or tablet views.

## Application NPM Dependencies Versions

- @mui/material: 7.2.0
- @mui/icons-material: 7.2.0
- next: 15.3.5

## Guidelines for Styles, Components and Icons

Prefer to use the custom components defined in `@/com/ui/comps` instead of basic HTML elements.
This ensures consistent styling and behavior across the application.

## Implementation Approach

Create only static UI components without complex logic implementation. Focus on proper component structure, styling, and layout using the specified libraries.
Do not implement business logic, state management, or complex interactions.
